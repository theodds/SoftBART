## The SoftBart package

This package implements the methodology described in the paper 

- Linero, A.R. and Yang, Y. (2018). *Bayesian tree ensembles that adapt to smoothness and sparsity.* Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B.

### New features on MFM Branch!!

Some new experimental features have been pushed to the MFM branch. These include:

- The Dirichlet prior for variable selection (i.e., DART) has been replaced with a Gibbs prior on the partition of the branches, or (equivalently), a "Mixture of Finite Mixtures" prior. See Miller and Harrison (2018, JASA) for a description of these priors in the context of Bayesian nonparametric mixture models. In addition to (suspected) better performance in theory and practice, the MCMC for the Gibbs prior should (hopefully) mix better.

- New Markov transistions are used, including sampling a tree from the prior and using a type of "Perturb" move due to Pratola (2016, Bayesian Analysis). This has substantial benefits for the mixing of the chain.

I plan to merge these changes into master once they are thoroughly tested.

### Installation

The package can be installed with the `devtools` package:
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("theodds/SoftBART")
```

Note that if you are on OSX you may need to install the gfortran library from
 https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/.
    
### Usage

The package is designed to mirror the functionality of the `BayesTree` package.
The function `softbart` is the primary function, and is used in essentially
the same manner as the `bart` function in `BayesTree`.

The following is a minimal example on "Friedman's example":


```{r fit_model, eval = FALSE}

## Load library
library(SoftBart)

## Functions used to generate fake data
set.seed(1234)
f_fried <- function(x) 10 * sin(pi * x[,1] * x[,2]) + 20 * (x[,3] - 0.5)^2 + 
                      10 * x[,4] + 5 * x[,5]
    
gen_data <- function(n_train, n_test, P, sigma) {
    X <- matrix(runif(n_train * P), nrow = n_train)
    mu <- f_fried(X)
    X_test <- matrix(runif(n_test * P), nrow = n_test)
    mu_test <- f_fried(X_test)
    Y <- mu + sigma * rnorm(n_train)
    Y_test <- mu_test + sigma * rnorm(n_test)
        
    return(list(X = X, Y = Y, mu = mu, X_test = X_test, Y_test = Y_test, mu_test = mu_test))
}

## Simiulate dataset
sim_data <- gen_data(250, 100, 1000, 1)
    
## Fit the model
hypers <- Hypers(sim_data$X, sim_data$Y, num_tree = 50, temperature = 1, 
                 sigma_hat = 1)
fit <- softbart(X = sim_data$X, Y = sim_data$Y, X_test = sim_data$X_test, 
                hypers = hypers,
                opts = Opts(num_burn = 5000, num_save = 5000, update_tau = TRUE,
                            update_sigma = FALSE))
    
## Plot the fit (note: interval estimates are not prediction intervals, 
## so they do not cover the predictions at the nominal rate)
## plot(fit)

## Look at posterior model inclusion probabilities for each predictor. 

posterior_probs <- function(fit) colMeans(fit$var_counts > 0)
plot(posterior_probs(fit), 
     col = ifelse(posterior_probs(fit) > 0.5, muted("blue"), muted("green")), 
     pch = 20)

rmse <- function(x,y) sqrt(mean((x-y)^2))

rmse(fit$y_hat_test_mean, sim_data$mu_test)
rmse(fit$y_hat_train_mean, sim_data$mu)

```
### Accessing the model from R

In more complex settings, one may wish to incorporate the SoftBART model as a component within a larger model. In this case, it is possible to construct a SoftBART object within `R` and do a single Gibbs sampling update.

```{r external_model, eval = FALSE}
a <- min(sim_data$Y)
b <- max(sim_data$Y)
Z <- (sim_data$Y - a) / (b - a) - 0.5
hypers <- Hypers(sim_data$X, sim_data$Y, sigma_hat = 1 / (b - a), num_tree = 50)
opts <- Opts(update_sigma = FALSE, num_burn = 5000, num_save = 5000)

forest <- MakeForest(hypers, opts)
mu_hat <- forest$do_gibbs(sim_data$X, Z, sim_data$X_test, opts$num_burn)
mu_hat <- forest$do_gibbs(sim_data$X, Z, sim_data$X_test, opts$num_save)
mu_hat <- (mu_hat + 0.5) * (b - a) + a
rmse(colMeans(mu_hat), sim_data$mu_test)
```

The `do_gibbs` function takes as input the data used to do the update, an additional set of points at which to predict, and the number of iterations to run the sampler. By default, the probability vector `s` will not be updated until at least `num_burn / 2` iterations have been run. This can be checked by calling `forest$num_gibbs`. The `s` vector itself can be obtained by calling `forest$get_s()`, and in the future we will add features to deal with other components as well. The code above first burns in and then samples from the posterior, and is essentially equivalent to using `softbart`. **WARNING**: if you are going to do this, you need to preprocess `X` and `X_test` by hand, so that all values lie in [0,1]. The `softbart` function, in addition to doing the sampling, also preprocesses `X` and `X_test` by applying a quantile transformation.
